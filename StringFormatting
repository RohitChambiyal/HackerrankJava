Respected Sir 
    As per your requirement on prescribed format of police verification received today by hand from your office today, 
my parents contacted personally my home police personally station and discussed with police authorities for completing
the formality. They suggested that in our state finger print matching facility is not availabe.
However we can provide character certificate.Please guide me in this regard please.
